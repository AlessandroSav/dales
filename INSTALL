DALES version 3.2
===================
Packages are available at www.gitorious.org/dales
If git is installed, the best way to obtain DALES is with:

git clone git://gitorious.org/dales/dales.git 
For updates you can then just use the command 
git pull origin master

Then follow the instructions below. 
1) cd dales 
2) mkdir build 
3) cd build 
4) cmake .. && make install

This should provide the dales3 binary in the top dir of dales. New builds can be
made by 'make install' in the build directory. The documentation is build by typing

make docs

in the build directory.



Dependencies of DALES are
1) MPI (the only obligatory one)
2) NetCDF (optional)
3) CMake (alternatively, the old makefile icw makedepf90 still works)
4) Doxygen, DOT and LaTeX for building the documentation
